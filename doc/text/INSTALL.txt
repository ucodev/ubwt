1. Installation

 The following command will automatically build and install ubwt (privileged user):

   # ./deploy


 Alternatively, if you want to only build ubwt and test it without installation (unprivileged user):

   $ ./do
   $ cd src
   $ ./ubwt -h


 For Raspberry PI deployment, set the build target before any of the commands above:

   $ ./target rpi


 You can enable stack protection (when available in the compiler) by running the following command before build or deploying:

   $ ./addon stackprot


 If you're building the ubwt on a Cygwin environment, the following commands shall be executed before deployment in order to avoid privilege checks during the installation:

   $ touch .nopriv
   $ touch .nopriv_install


 See README.md for usage information
