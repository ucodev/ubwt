 - This tool is not meant to sued as a system service - it is not a daemon,
   and wasn't designed to become one.

 - If you need to auto-restart the listener, use a loop in the shell, eg:

       while :; do
         ubwt listener 0.0.0.0
	 if [ ${?} -ne 0 ]; then break; fi
       done

 - If you are running the test in a system with poor real time measurements,
   use -M with a reasonable multiplier value, for example, 10.

 - Asynchronous full-duplex test mode may not be completely fair.
   Use it to get estimates, not precise measurements.

 - Avoid using UDP tests unless you really know what you are doing.

 - Balance the number of workers properly - more workers is usually good,
   until too much workers become very bad. Start with something like 4 or 8.

 - To adjust precision, make sure MTU and L4 payload size are properly set
   for the network under test. Usually the default values are OK, but
   fine tunning these values may yield better results.

 - When testing symmetric links with bidirectional tests and you find out
   that there's a considerable difference between the download and upload
   measurements, slightly increase the default value of -o (to 5 or 10
   seconds). This assumes that you already excluded any other reasons,
   such as traffic from other sources present in the network that is
   tampering the bandwidth test.

 - If a measurement doens't feel right, start by increasing the minimum stream
   time with the -t option.
