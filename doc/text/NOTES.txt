 - This tool is not meant to sued as a system service - it is not a daemon,
   and wasn't designed to become one.

 - If you need to auto-restart the listener, use a loop in the shell, eg:

       while :; do
         ubwt listener 0.0.0.0
	 if [ ${?} -ne 0 ]; then break; fi
       done

 - If you are running the test in a system with poor real time measurements,
   use -M with a reasonable multiplier value, for example, 10.

 - Asynchronous full-duplex test mode may not be completely fair.
   Use it to get estimates, not precise measurements.

 - Avoid using UDP tests unless you really know what you are doing.

 - Balance the number of workers properly - more workers is usually good,
   until too much workers become very bad. Start with something like 4 or 8.

 - To adjust precision, make sure MTU and L4 payload size are properly set
   for the network under test. Usually the default values are OK, but
   fine tunning these values may yield better results.

 - When testing symmetric links with bidirectional tests and you find out
   that there's a considerable difference between the download and upload
   measurements, slightly increase the default value of -o (to 5 or 10
   seconds). This assumes that you already excluded any other reasons,
   such as traffic from other sources present in the network that is
   tampering the bandwidth test.

 - If a measurement doens't feel right, start by increasing the minimum stream
   time with the -t option.

 - When performing tests over compressed links and compression is not desired,
   make use of the -B and -C options so the sender payload is not set to 0
   (which it is by default). Using /dev/random as the source for -C usually
   delivers good results in these situationsi, but a test with /dev/zero
   should be performed first to serve as a base comparision, as well as to
   exclude any processing overhead that is added by the sending routine while
   reading from the buffer, and writting to the payload, for each transmission
   unit. Note that -B and -C options have no effect on the receiver side.

 - A connector is a sender by default, unless -R is set, making it a receiver.

 - A listener is a receiver by default, unless -R is set, making it a sender.

 - When using -b, both connector and listener will act as a sender and as a
   receiver.
