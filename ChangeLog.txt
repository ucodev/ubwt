v0.01c-dev

 - Included TCP support (default proto)


v0.01b-dev

 - Added per-OS errno configuration (Issue #2 and #3)

 - Added missing header netinet/in.h in src/net.c (Issue #2)

 - Increased l4 proto name buffer (config.h) to avoid warnings on some
   compilers (Issue #1): There is no undefined behaviour with the previous
   value, but some compilers are too sensitive and they are not looking
   ahead to find out that the string is being NULL-terminated correctly.
